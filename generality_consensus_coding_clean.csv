more it gets complicating,2,two10103,2,8.3,101573,spec,Because if you go in this way it proves your point about the 2 substances,1,one10103,2,8.3,101467,Yes,So that way you can show that you know what your talking about in case of a pop quiz,1,one10103,2,8.3,101544,gen,Your model should work for any situation not just one,4,four10103,2,8.3,101368,spec,If the question is what does copper plus acedic acid make it doesnt help to say what hydrogen and oxygen make,3,three10103,2,8.3,101460,spec,It is better to focus on things then to just tell the general of it,1,one10103,2,8.3,101479,gen,Because models arent always about copper and vinerger,4,four10103,2,8.3,101480,spec,People my age understand how chemical reactions work and make new stuff We need to learn how to interact with other substances,2,two10103,2,8.3,101547,spec,It should because that was what happened during the experiment,1,one10103,2,8.3,101458,spec,So it could give us specific details,1,one10103,2,8.3,101424,gen,Because it is good to know how in all situations,2,two10103,2,8.3,101491,gen,You could show a breif overview of everything,2,two10103,2,8.3,101571,spec,Because it shows me that there is a chemical reaction,1,one10103,2,8.3,101377,spec,It would show how the entire thing is produced,1,one10103,2,8.3,101459,spec,So people know what kind of substances mix together to make a new substance,2,two10103,3,8.3,101370,Yes,Because I show molecules increasing in speed are the reaction part between copper and acetic acid,1,one10103,3,8.3,101536,spec ,That can explain the atoms better,2,two10103,3,8.3,101305,gen,To show what is going on the experiment,1,one10103,3,8.3,101505,spec,I think B explains the lesson and question more so thats why it would be the beter answer,1,one10103,3,8.3,101545,gen,Because models should be short simple and to the point,1,one10103,3,8.3,101301,gen,I think A because then you can explain how it interacts to form new things generaly,4,four10103,3,8.3,101482,spec,My opinion on the multiple choice is b because then you learn about the factors that mainly cause the substance to react,2,two10103,3,8.3,101466,blank,Because the cemig rauted,nc,none10103,3,8.3,101575,spec,I think it should be formed on B because in my diagram it talks about how the copper turned green,1,one10103,3,8.3,101308,both,Because you have to show how the substances interact with each other You also have to use specific substances because if you right substance down how will the reader know what it is,6,six10103,3,8.3,101430,spec,Because there are too many ways for a chemical reaction to happen that a single model could not show them all,2,two10103,3,8.3,101576,spec,Because we do the experiments so we can see the reactions,1,one10103,3,8.3,101461,spec,Because it should talk about how they form,1,one10103,3,8.3,101539,gen,Because my model shows a chemical reaction All chemical reactions form a new substance,4,four10103,5,8.3,101382,spec,Because it shows the answer more clearly,1,one10103,5,8.3,101579,spec,Because it shows the outcome It also shows what happens,1,one10103,5,8.3,101577,Yes,Everything makes a new thing,1,one10103,5,8.3,101489,Yes,Because thats what people need to know about the experiment,1,one10103,5,8.3,101580,spec,Because different substances may cause different results,2,two10103,5,8.3,101498,spec,The model was to explain what the bubbling in this chemical reaction was not just any chemical reaction,5,five10103,5,8.3,101395,Yes,So people know what you model is about,1,one10103,5,8.3,101488,spec,It is always better to learn specific things,1,one10103,5,8.3,101495,spec,To let students know how and why they bond together,2,two10103,5,8.3,101371,spec,Because that is a specific thing that we did and for other chemical reactions it may be different,2,two10103,5,8.3,101477,blank,blank,nc,none10103,5,8.3,101391,spec,I think B because thats a better explanation and it can tell you more,1,one10103,5,8.3,101360,spec,Because that is what my model is mostly about,1,one10103,5,8.3,101404,Yes,So the model could explain the answer specifically so you could ,1,one10103,5,8.3,101313,gen,Because we should know how things generally work so we can apply it to our lives but we sohuld not focus on random cemical reactions,4,four10103,5,8.3,101578,gen,I think this because we just need to know the structure of the substances not every detail because those are not important,2,two10103,5,8.3,101397,spec,Because I spicificly use copper and acetic acid and show how they mixe and creat copper acetate,1,one10103,5,8.3,101496,spec,Because then it will be better explained and have the specific atoms that made that specific chemical reaction,2,two10103,5,8.3,101421,spec,Because each chemical reaction can have different substances,2,two10103,6,8.3,101525,gen,I showed the substance changing,1,one10103,6,8.3,101386,gen,Because that would make sense,1,one10103,6,8.3,101474,spec,You want to be more specific in a model when you make one,1,one10103,6,8.3,101309,spec,Because thats the whole point of the model,1,one10103,6,8.3,101340,gen,Because a model explaines how they get to the ending point so I think itÍs a,1,one10103,6,8.3,101584,spec,It would help show more and make it be more accurate,2,two10103,6,8.3,101582,gen,It was supposed to show why the mixture foamed not how the spefics were created,1,one10103,6,8.3,101356,blank,A general way so that it explains more than one situation,2,two10103,6,8.3,101512,gen,If it explains a general way on how substances interact the model will be simpler and easier to understand,2,two10103,6,8.3,101457,spec,A model shows how a chemical reaction occurs with the chemicals substances and how substances and chemicals to compare substances and properties,1,one10103,6,8.3,101328,gen,Cause we wanted to no how new substunces were made,1,one10103,6,8.3,101312,spec,Because it is good to be specific,1,one10103,6,8.3,101504,gen,So the crowd would understand,2,two10103,8,8.3,101322,spec,Because its sometimes the little things,nc,none10103,8,8.3,101307,blank,blank,nc,none10103,8,8.3,101323,spec,Because the question is asking you about only 1 specific thing and if I talked about all the chemical reactions in general it would not make sense because in different chemical reactions different things happen like bubble fix smell etc,2,two10103,8,8.3,101403,spec,Because you cant just say reactant goes to substances you have to say copper plus acetic acid goes to copper acedite,5,five10103,8,8.3,101542,spec,Your model should describe exactly what youre talking about,1,one10103,8,8.3,101349,spec,Because if theirs too much stuff going on we wont undrstand it,2,two10103,8,8.3,101355,spec,Because then you know exactly how it works and why it interacts,2,two10103,8,8.3,101332,spec,Because thats the main idea of the experament,1,one10103,8,8.3,101392,blank,Yes because thats what makes a good model,1,one10103,8,8.3,101501,Yes,It helps the person better understand what you explaining in your model,2,two10103,8,8.3,101464,spec,That way it is more specific,1,one10103,8,8.3,101438,spec,In science it shouldnt just be general it should be a focus In science you should focus on something speciffic,1,one10103,8,8.3,101587,spec,So whenever someone looks at it they can see and tell what happened and with what it happened with,2,two10103,8,8.3,101586,spec,It gives more reasoning and evidence,2,two10103,8,8.3,101447,spec,I think that its B because it should just focus on that one question because the answer would explain more,2,two10103,8,8.3,101585,spec,Because its more detailed,1,one10402,2,8.3,104136,spec,that is what it did,1,one10402,2,8.3,104208,spec,because we are trying to find out how the green substance formed on the penny,1,one10402,2,8.3,104132,spec,because we are trying to find out how the green substance formed on the penny,1,one10402,2,8.3,104162,spec,because we are trying to find out how the green substance formed on the penny,1,one10402,2,8.3,104128,spec,i think it should do b because we are concentrating on how copper and acetic acid form copper acetate,2,two10402,2,8.3,104204,spec,not all atoms react the same way,3,three10402,2,8.3,104147,spec,because the model shows how and why the substances interact,1,one10402,2,8.3,104196,spec,because thats why its a model to show what and how its happening,1,one10402,2,8.3,104186,spec,its a model to show how and what happened to make copper acetate,1,one10402,2,8.3,104110,spec,because were trying to learn if acid rain makes new substances,4,four10402,2,8.3,104156,spec,because specific answers have a easily and more understandable to find,nc,none10402,2,8.3,104192,spec,because we are talking about those things not other stuff,1,one10402,2,8.3,104150,spec,so that we can understand it better,nc,none10402,2,8.3,104139,spec,because if we didnt then we wouldnt know about what was happening,2,two10402,2,8.3,104107,gen,the model shows not only how it works for these molecules but how it will work for other molecules,4,four10402,2,8.3,104120,spec,i think a model should explain this because if you just,nc,none10402,2,8.3,104108,gen,it should focus generally so that it can apply to more than one chemical reaction the readers general knowledge about chemical reactions,4,four10402,2,8.3,104137,spec,because this shows us how they react,1,one10402,2,8.3,104158,spec,it is more specific and more important to know you will focus on specific things which is better than general things,2,two10402,2,8.3,104129,gen,well because our goal of this model is to figure out what the reactants made and a explains our goal,1,one10402,2,8.3,104148,spec,we should focus on this because if we draw general models we wont know what we are mixing and what the product is,2,two10402,2,8.3,104189,spec,the model should show this because you need to know specific substances,1,one10402,4,8.3,104126,spec,we used the specific molecules and atoms to represent a certain model,1,one10402,4,8.3,104200,spec,it should focus on a specific substance because it can interact with them better especially the atoms,2,two10402,4,8.3,104115,spec,we used the specific molecules and atoms to represent a certain experiment,1,one10402,4,8.3,104103,spec,we used the specific molecules and atoms to represent a certain experiment,1,one10402,4,8.3,104157,spec,because we are focusing on the chemical reaction that happened on the copper without touching the vinegar,1,one10402,4,8.3,104165,spec,were focused on acetic acid in the air that effects things and not all chemical reactions are caused with air,3,three10402,4,8.3,104143,spec,it describes in details how the two molecule forms formed,1,one10402,4,8.3,104138,spec,because then our model is accurate and it,nc,none10402,4,8.3,104173,spec,because you cant just talk about how substances interact with each other you need a specific detailed explanation,2,two10402,4,8.3,104106,spec,because our model shows the equation for copper acetate when basically shows how copper and acetic acid and have a chemical reaction turn into copper acetate,1,one10402,4,8.3,104140,spec,because general ways lead to many different ideas and not whats important,2,two10402,4,8.3,104209,spec,yes because general is now specific,nc,none10402,4,8.3,104184,gen,it should explain how the chemicals create a chemical reaction and form a new substance,1,one10402,4,8.3,104114,gen,because we think that copper and acetic acid interact to form new substances the same way that any other substance interact,4,four10402,4,8.3,104111,gen,because we think the copper and acetic acid interact to form new substances,4,four10402,4,8.3,104164,spec,it will explain more of what happened,2,two10402,4,8.3,104210,spec,because it will explain more of what happened,2,two10402,4,8.3,104178,spec,because it describes in detail how everything happens,2,two10402,4,8.3,104121,gen,it makes us learn more from less and making it easier for us to understand science better,2,two10402,6,8.3,104141,spec,our model should focus on specific substances so we can see how they interact and form new ones but based on the lab that we did so we know what happens with an accurate example,2,two10402,6,8.3,104135,gen,i think that because that is what we were studying,1,one10402,6,8.3,104125,gen,the process is the same for each chemical reaction so it wouldnt make sense to model each chemical reaction,4,four10402,6,8.3,104109,gen,the process is similar for all chemical reactions so it would make sense to have a general representation,4,four10402,6,8.3,104105,gen,the process is the similar for all chemical reactions so it would make sense to do every single reaction using the same model,4,four10402,6,8.3,104193,gen,the process is the same for all chemical reactions so it wouldnt make sense to model each chemical reactions,4,four10402,6,8.3,104154,gen,the process if the same for all chemical reaction so it would not make sense,4,four10402,6,8.3,104123,gen,i think it should be this way because it can explain other theories of chemical reactions,4,four10402,6,8.3,104207,spec,because it focuses on one specific chemical reaction,1,one10402,6,8.3,104112,spec,because it focuses on one chemical reaction,1,one10402,6,8.3,104163,spec,yes because,nc,none10402,6,8.3,104166,gen,it should be this way because it can explain other theories of chemical reactions,4,four10402,6,8.3,104153,spec,yes because,nc,none10402,6,8.3,104195,spec,i think that the model would be better this way so that it could be a specific and stonger model it would also make it easier to understand this way,2,two10402,6,8.3,104175,spec,to focus on two substances is less confusing,2,two10402,6,8.3,104118,spec,because it is a chemical reaction and then it can show different things like chemical reaction and ,nc,none10402,6,8.3,104104,spec,yes because each chemical reaction has different reactions and the model wont be as accurate,2,two10402,6,8.3,104134,gen,it should be this way because it has millions of ,nc,none10402,6,8.3,104101,gen,it should be this way because it can explain other theories of chemical reactions,4,four10402,7,8.3,104160,spec,so we know all the substances that we need in order to learn and stuff,1,one10402,7,8.3,104131,gen,because it helps describe the reactions better,2,two10402,7,8.3,104181,gen,it helps describe the reactions better,2,two10402,7,8.3,104117,gen,because it helps us describe the reactions better,2,two10402,7,8.3,104202,spec,blank,nc,none10402,7,8.3,104183,spec,to focus on one thing to figure out more,2,two10402,7,8.3,104201,gen,you will have a general idea for other models,2,two10402,7,8.3,104176,gen,i chose a because if you have a general model then you can use it for more than one chemical reaction,4,four10402,7,8.3,104197,gen,because were focusing on more than one chemical,1,one10402,7,8.3,104177,spec,because your trying to know how and was it that made the penny green,1,one10402,7,8.3,104145,spec,b is more specific about a substance,1,one10402,7,8.3,104198,spec,because by making a model your showing what point your proving,1,one10402,7,8.3,104168,gen,because you can use the info for different,nc,none
